### 💡 | Programming languages that I know :

- Java
- Python
- C#
- C\C++ (recently refreshing on, mostly for scientific computation)
- HTML, CSS
- MATLAB/Octave

### My experience in coding :

[![Top Langs](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api/top-langs/?username=ItsAdamLY)](https://github.com/anuraghazra/github-readme-stats)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 💡 | Code Writing style preference:

Allman for most languages, including for Java and C/C++.
camelCase for most languages, except C# (UpperCase) and Python and similar (snake_case) for methods/functions,
UpperCase for classes for all languages. Variable naming in C# follow camelCase as in Java, including for private variables (i.e. no (_)).

Whitespaces between each conditional and loop statements, none between try and catch clauses.

Writing example in Java:

```java
public class HalloClass
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        try
        {
            if ()
            {
                
            }

            else
            {
                
            }
        }
        catch ()
        {
            
        }
    }
}

```
